Config variables can be defined in following ways:

Laravel:

    As constants
    [
        'field' => 'value'
    ]

    As closures
    [
        'field' => function(){return 'value';}
    ]

    As services
    [
        'field' => ['service@function']
    ]

    As class functions
    [
        'field' => ['\full\path\to\class@function']
    ]

Symfony:

    As constants
    group:
        field: 'value'

    As services
    group:
        field:
            service: 'service.name'
            function: 'function'
