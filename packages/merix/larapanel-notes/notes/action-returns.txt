Actions can return following things:

- refresh: force reload current data
- redirect: redirect browser to custom URL
- open-edit: open a new edit (if edit is already opened it will stack new one on top of current)
- close-edit: close edit that is on top of stack
- fill-fields: fill fields with returned data
- errors: show errors on certain fields
- message: show global message that will disappear after 2 seconds
- popup: show global message that will stay until dismissed


Action combinations:

- open-edit + fill-fields: will fill the fields with data returned with close-edit
- close-edit + fill-fields: will send data to be closed

eg. Create a new related object and connect it to current one
{
    "open-edit": {
        "admin": "related-admin",
        "id": "0"
    },

    "fill-fields": {
        "relation-field": "_",
        "relation-id-field": "id",
        "relation-name-field": "name",
        "+multi-relation-field": ["id"],
    },
}

than when closing:

{
    "close-edit": {
        "admin": "related-admin",
        "id": "0"
    },

    "fill-fields": {            // This will set relation-field with serialized entity
        "id": "14",             // This will set relation-id-field to 14 and add 14 to multi-relation-field
        "name": "something",    // This will set relation-name-field to something
    },
}
